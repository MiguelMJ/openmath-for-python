# Contributing to Openmath for Python

Thanks for thinking about contributing to Openmath for Python! Here are the steps to do it.

1. Read this document (you are on the right path in this moment).
2. Check if there's any open issue with your idea, and whether it is already assigned to someone or not.
3. If it is not, then you can open a new issue or comment in the existent one and I will assign it to you.
4. Fork the repo and make your changes in the dev branch.
5. Make a pull request.

## Where is help wanted?

- Writing more extensive tests.
- Documenting new use cases or adding functioning examples.

If you have more ideas, we can discuss them!
